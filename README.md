# Pomodoro-timer
Pomodoro style timer that lets user set focus and break time.
Following the pomodoro style, the web application is programmed to alternate timers between focus and break until the user decides to stop the intervals.
It can be used as a reminder for when to take a break and when to focus again.
Added a progress bar for visual aesthetics.
Thanks to this project, I was able to get a really good grasp on React.js at last. I intend to add more visual features to this project in the future, as checking to see if I need to refactor code to a more efficient one.
Written with HTML, CSS, and React.js.
